School project HTML/CSS/JS/HeadlessCMS

- h1 for brand name and logo on every page bcs of text size hierarchy

-i used some styles in global several times,(not DRY) bcs there was some content that i used on all of my pages, and in that way i didnt have to put on to many classes to the elements. 

- some class styles are repetative, but i kept the same class name for consistency. i didnt want to make them on global when they were on only two pages.

- some styles are the same on different pages like the arrow button, but bcs index and posts css page both have some lines, i chose to just repeat myself on some classes insted of link both css sheet to both html.
