## Description

James Cooks food blog is my exam assignment project where I've put to use everything I learned this past year. The site includes a home page, a contact section for any questions, an about page that tells you more about the blog, a post page where all the blog posts are listed, and individual pages for each recipe. I've designed it to be super user-friendly and responsive, making sure it works great on any device. It's a cool mix of all the skills I've picked up, and I'm excited to share it with you!

- Interactive Home Page: Incorporated a dynamic carousel showcasing the latest blog posts, optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
- Blog Pages with Load More Functionality: Designed the blog pages to initially display 10 posts, with an option to load more, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Dynamic Blog Post Pages: Each blog post is displayed on its own page, with content and titles that update dynamically based on user selection.
- Enhanced User Interaction: Developed a modal feature for image viewing on the blog pages and implemented a contact form with robust JavaScript validations.
- WordPress Integration: Utilized WordPress as a Headless CMS, demonstrating my ability to integrate a RESTful API for dynamic content management.
- Responsive and Accessible Design: Ensured the website is responsive across various devices and adheres to WCAG accessibility guidelines.

This project was not only a technical challenge, but also a creative process. allowing me to explore various aspects of web development. Check out the live site on Netlify and axplore the code on Github for a deeoer dive into my work!
